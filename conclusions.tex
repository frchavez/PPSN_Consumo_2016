\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

We have presented a preliminary study on the power consumption behavior of a well known Ea: the Genetic Programming algorithm.  We have analyzed the behavior of a benchmark GP problem, the multiplexer-6, and have run it using \textit{lilgp} on different hardware devices running a number of operating systems, from blade systems using different Linux distributions to tablet devices running android.

One of the first thing we have learned, is that although devices with better processors can run the algorithm more quickly, they spent larger amounts of energy, and the total energy required to find a solution is thus also larger.  This means that although the standard preference for better hardware platforms and processors allows to find solutions more quickly, it incurs in waste of energy that should be considered:  it is much more energy efficient to run the algorithm on a raspberry pi or a tablet device.

Secondly, we have seen the influence that some of the main parameters of the algorithm may have on the power consumed:  changing population sizes automatically produce a change the energy required to reach solutions, and this is a hint on future analysis.  We should carefully consider how each of the parameters of the algorithm may also influence the amount of energy consumed when looking for solutions.
